# TemperatureMonitorSystem

This app allows users to view the temperature and humidity in a room. It fetches data from the API backend in the `src/api`

The temperature and humidity data is obtained from the [TemperatureMonitorESP32](https://github.com/LuWroblewski/TemperatureMonitorESP32) repository.
